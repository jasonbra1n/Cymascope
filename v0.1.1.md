# Cymascope v0.1.1 Release Notes

This is a patch release that addresses a critical bug affecting the fullscreen mode functionality.

## 🔧 Fixes & Refinements

- **Critical Fullscreen Fix**: This release resolves a persistent and complex bug where the main controls overlay would not reappear after exiting fullscreen mode, especially on browsers like Chrome and Brave. The issue was particularly noticeable when exiting via the `ESC` key.

  The fix involved a significant refactor of the application's core layout, moving from a Flexbox-based approach to a more robust CSS Grid structure. Additionally, event handling for fullscreen state changes was improved to explicitly trigger a canvas resize, ensuring all UI elements return to their correct state and position reliably across different browsers.
