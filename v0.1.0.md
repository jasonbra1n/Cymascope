# Cymascope v0.1.0 Release Notes

This is a significant feature release, transforming the initial proof-of-concept into a full-featured, interactive web application. This version introduces a host of new capabilities, a complete UI overhaul, and foundational improvements for future development.

## ✨ New Features

- **Tuner Overlay**: A real-time tuner has been added, displaying the dominant incoming frequency and its closest musical note.
- **Selectable Tuning Systems**: Users can now switch the tuner's reference between the standard A=440Hz and the alternative A=432Hz.
- **Frequency Scaling**: A new "Frequency Scale" slider gives users direct control over how audio frequencies are mapped to the visual patterns.
- **Theme Switching**: The application now supports both Light and Dark themes, with a toggle to switch between them. The user's preference is saved locally.
- **Theme Sync for Embedding**: The app can now listen for theme changes from a parent application (like the LAB Digital Workshop) and update its theme accordingly.

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Modern Overlay Layout**: The controls have been moved into a sleek, semi-transparent "frosted glass" overlay at the bottom of the screen. This provides a clean, single-view layout that maximizes space for the visualization.
- **Adaptive UI**: All UI elements, including the new overlays, are now theme-aware, ensuring excellent readability and a consistent look in both light and dark modes.
- **Compact Header**: The header has been redesigned to be more compact and navbar-like, giving more vertical space to the main content.

## 🔧 Fixes & Refinements

- **Test Tone Restored**: The audible sine wave tone for the "TEST VISUALIZATION" mode has been fixed and restored.
- **Initial Refactor**: The project has been refactored from a single script into a clean, modular structure with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Project Documentation**: Core project files like `README.md`, `roadmap.md`, and `changelog.md` have been created to guide development and contributions.
